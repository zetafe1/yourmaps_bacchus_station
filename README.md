This is a free MLO for your server so you can understand how MLO works.

One basic MLO with 2 ydr (drawables) + 1 ybn (colision mloarchetype) + 1 world ybn

All props are part of the MLOArchetype, so they do not count on ydr pool, they are part of the MLO.
Please understand how native interiors work and do not take for granted what some people say about MLO when they want to sell you non-native solutions.

"Why Choose MLO (Multi Level Object)?

MLO (Multi Level Object) offers the highest level of optimization for interior environments compared to other non-native solutions. 
When implemented correctly, with a well-considered number of rooms and portals, it significantly enhances performance. 
Additionally, MLO supports the use of reflection probes, which improve the visual quality of interiors by adding realistic reflections. 

Rooms in MLO serve as a crucial optimization tool by compartmentalizing interior spaces. 
This means that objects within a room are only rendered if they are visible from your current location. 
For instance, if you are in Room A and cannot see Room B, the game will not render objects in Room B. 
Even if there is a portal (an opening) between the rooms without any obstruction (doors), only the items visible through the portal will be rendered, minimizing unnecessary rendering. 

Portals are powerful features in MLO that control the rendering process efficiently. 
They ensure that only necessary objects are rendered, which greatly improves performance. 
For example, portals can limit the rendering to only the parts of objects visible through them, including elements like outdoor scenery such as trees and terrain. 
This selective rendering approach reduces the computational load by not rendering everything outside your current view. Below is an example illustrating how portals function. 

Reflection probes enhance the appearance of interiors by adding realistic reflections to reflective materials. 
This not only solves issues like the unrealistic appearance of metallic surfaces but also significantly improves the overall aesthetic of the interior. 
Light entering through windows and other reflective surfaces is accurately mirrored, adding depth and realism to the environment.

Choosing MLO for interior rendering offers unparalleled optimization and visual fidelity. 
By intelligently managing which parts of the environment are rendered through the use of rooms and portals, MLO significantly improves performance. 
Additionally, the integration of reflection probes elevates the aesthetic quality, providing realistic reflections that enhance the visual experience. 
For developers and designers aiming for high performance and stunning interiors, MLO stands out as the optimal solution."
